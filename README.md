# Tata-Group-Data-Analytics-Job-Simulation-on-Forage
#Project Summary

As part of the Tata iQ GenAI-Powered Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage, I worked as an AI Transformation Consultant within the Financial Services Data & AI Strategy Team. Under the guidance of Senior Manager Charithra, I collaborated with Geldium Finance, a digital lending company, to address rising credit card delinquency rates.

The core objective was to design an AI-powered predictive system capable of identifying at-risk customers and recommending personalized, fair, and explainable intervention strategies. I analyzed key behavioral and demographic data to uncover drivers of payment default and developed a model using GenAI tools to assess delinquency risk across customer tiers.

To ensure responsible deployment, I integrated ethical AI principles such as fairness audits, explainability tools, human-in-the-loop controls, and regulatory compliance. I outlined specific customer touchpoints and decision rules where automation and human oversight would intersect.

As a key deliverable, I created and presented a PowerPoint deck summarizing the system design, decision logic, deployment roadmap, and business impact. This helped clearly communicate the strategy to internal stakeholders and client leadership, securing buy-in for the proposed pilot rollout.

Through this project, I demonstrated strengths in predictive modeling, financial risk strategy, responsible AI practices, and strategicÂ communication.
