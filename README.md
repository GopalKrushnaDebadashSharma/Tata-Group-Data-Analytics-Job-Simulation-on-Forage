## 🚀 Project Objective

As an *AI Transformation Consultant* in a simulated engagement with *Tata iQ's Financial Services AI Strategy Team, I designed a GenAI-powered solution to help **Geldium Finance* reduce rising credit card delinquency rates.

The goal:  
✔ Predict customer delinquency risk  
✔ Recommend AI-driven yet ethical interventions  
✔ Drive repayment rates & ensure compliance
